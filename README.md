### What I learned

This was made very fast as I have leant a lot about how to make use of flex, containers and cards.
I took a minimal to no help of internet for css and got this thing aligned in no time.
I think it is all work of practice you do. It has been the fourth challenge and so far pretty fast and smooth one.
